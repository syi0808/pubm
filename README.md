## FAQ

### Why does jsr only ask for tokens?

The only way to access jsrâ€™s certified environment is through a direct API request with a token.

### How is the jsr token stored? Is it secure?

The jsr token is encrypted and stored using various layers of information. As long as you have control over the local machine where pubm was run, it is highly unlikely the token can be compromised.

If you prefer not to save tokens, you can use the `--no-save-token` option, which will request the token each time.
